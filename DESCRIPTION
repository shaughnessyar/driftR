Description: A tidy implementation of equations that correct for instrumental drift in 
    continuous water quality monitoring data.  There are many sources of water quality data 
    including private (ex: YSI instruments) and open source (ex: USGS and NDBC), each of 
    which are susceptible to errors/inaccuracies due to drift. This package allows the 
    user to correct their data using one or two standard reference values in a uniform, 
    reproducible way. The equations implemented are from Hasenmueller (2011)
    <doi:10.7936/K7N014KS>.
